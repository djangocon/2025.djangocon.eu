## Local Development

### Using venv

_optional_ - Create a virtual environment

```bash
python -m venv env
```

install requirements:

```bash

> pip install -r requirements/[ local | production ].txt
```

### Using Docker

```bash
python setup_env.py
docker compose build
docker compose up
```

To access the running Django container, use `docker compose exec django /bin/bash`.
But please note that currently, `manage.py migrate` doesn't work, you need to use the provided `sqlite3.db`.

### Database seed (`sqlite3.db`)

After setting up the Django project,
point your local settings to the pre-populated SQLite database by appending the following to `config/settings/local.py`:

```python
import os

# Database
# https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.9/ref/settings/#databases
DATABASES = {
    "default": {
        "ENGINE": "django.db.backends.sqlite3",
        "NAME": os.path.join(BASE_DIR, "db.sqlite3"),
    }
}
```
