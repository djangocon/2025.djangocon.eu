title: Getting around
layout: simple

Dublin's city centre is relatively small in size and you could stroll from the GPO to Stephens Green in under an hour, taking in the sights on the way.

A handy hint if you are trying to locate an address, postal codes are always odd numbers on the Northside and even numbers on the Southside. As a rule of thumb, the higher the number, the further away the location will be from the city centre.

If you would like to cover some distance, then Dublin has a good public transport network with a choice of buses, two tram lines (the Luas), a local area train running all the way along Dublin Bay (the Dart) and a large number of taxis.
