title: Getting around
layout: simple

Dublin's city centre is relatively small in size and you could stroll from the GPO to Stephens Green in under an hour, taking in the sights on the way.
A handy hint if you are trying to locate an address, postal codes are always odd numbers on the Northside and even numbers on the Southside. As a rule of thumb, the higher the number, the further away the location will be from the city centre.
If you would like to cover some distance, then Dublin has a good public transport network with a choice of buses, two tram lines (the Luas), a local area train running all the way along Dublin Bay (the Dart) and a large number of taxis.

<!-- Vigo is a small city and you can walk almost everywhere, although Vigo is well-known for its hills (so be prepared to walk up and down!). Nowadays, there are a lot of escalators to help you with that.
To get around in Vigo and if you want to go to nearby beaches, the best option is public transportation, bus or taxi. -->
