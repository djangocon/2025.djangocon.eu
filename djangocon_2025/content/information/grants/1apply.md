title: How to Apply
layout: simple

Lastly, we know that some of you reading this will need clarification on whether it's proper for you to apply for a grant. That's why we want to stress:

- Have you already attended a conference in the past? That's OK.
- Have you already received a grant in the past? Still OK.
- Don't have much experience with Django? That's OK, too.
- Don't want to take money away from someone else? It's OK, everyone says that!
- Don't feel like you deserve this? That's also OK: you do.

With our limited funds, we can't promise you will receive a grant, but if you're not sure, **we encourage you to apply**. If you're uncomfortable with other people knowing you received a grant, you don't have to tell themâ€”our policy is to never publicly identify grant applicants or recipients without their explicit permission.
