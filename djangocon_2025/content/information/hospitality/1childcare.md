Childcare at DjangoCon Europe and tech conferences are essential factors that help folks who otherwise may not be able to attend. We want to make sure that parents feel welcome bringing their children to DjangoCon Europe and that the availability of childcare is not a barrier to attending.

The Childcare Application Opening will be on March 1st. The closing date for will be March 31th, 23:59 UTC.
We look forward to seeing you - and your kids - soon in Dublin!
