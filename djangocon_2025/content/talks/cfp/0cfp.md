This page contains all information regarding the proposal process for DjangoCon Europe â€“ we will update it regularly as new information becomes available.

The **Call for Proposals (CFP)** is closed now.

It's a new year. What better way to start it than submitting your talk or workshop for **DjangoCon Europe 2025**, in beautiful **Dublin, Ireland?**

We're looking for talks on technical and non-technical topics accessible to all skill levels and submissions from new and seasoned speakers.

If you're asking, "Can I do this?" The answer is yes. If you have a topic that interests you, then it interests us.

If you've got half an idea or are still deciding in any way and want to chat, you can jump on the DjangoCon Europe Slack and find us there.

Please don't be shy; we want to hear from you!

We'll see you in Dublin!
